# FEEDBACK_AUDIT — grounding of SKILLS_FEEDBACK.md against the actual session

Each claim in `SKILLS_FEEDBACK.md` is checked against **this conversation's** tool calls and outputs
(not the repo files). Verdicts: **GROUNDED** (an event/output I can cite), **DOC** (grounded, but as
my reading of a skill's `SKILL.md` text rather than an event), **OVERSTATED** (some basis, wording
claims more), **UNSUPPORTED** (no evidence it happened).

| # | Claim | Verdict | Evidence in this conversation (tool call → quoted snippet) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `asta` CLI already installed, **v0.101.1**, token valid | GROUNDED | `Bash: which asta … asta --version` → `/Users/maxwellsdm/.local/bin/asta` and `asta, version 0.101.1`; `asta auth status` → `Local Token Status … ✅ Valid`, `Email … arthurh@allenai.org` |
| 2 | Invoked `asta-assistant:run` | GROUNDED | `Skill(asta-assistant:run)` → returned the run router `SKILL.md` |
| 3 | Opened run / brainstorm / plan-work / do-work | GROUNDED | `Skill(asta-assistant:run)`; `Bash: cat …/brainstorm/SKILL.md`; `Bash: cat …/plan-work/SKILL.md …/do-work/SKILL.md` (all outputs shown) |
| 4 | review-/save-work "only saw named in the router's state table" | OVERSTATED (minor) | The run `SKILL.md` "Status conventions" table names review-plan/review-work/save-work; **but** they are also named inside `plan-work/SKILL.md` ("Invoke **review-plan**") and `do-work/SKILL.md` ("Skill(asta-assistant:review-work) … save-work"). Core claim (never opened their own `SKILL.md`) is true; "only … router's state table" is imprecise |
| 5 | Invoked `asta-tools:analyze-data` (DataVoyager) on the 4 CSVs | GROUNDED | `Skill(asta-tools:analyze-data)`; `Bash: asta analyze-data submit … train_cond{25,100,200,400}Hz.csv.gz` → 4 `uploaded: …` lines |
| 6 | submit → background-poll → notify; 4 CSVs uploaded; poll exited & pinged | GROUNDED | submit output = 4 `uploaded:` lines; `Bash(run_in_background): asta analyze-data poll` → "running in background with ID: b0y6kay22"; later `task-notification … b0y6kay22 … completed` |
| 7 | DataVoyager reproduced passive params; **its C = 86/73/72/63 pF, τ_m = 8.4/6.0/6.6/9.9 ms** | GROUNDED | Parsed DV log cell 9: `25Hz … τ≈8.45 C≈85.8`, `100Hz τ≈6.00 C≈73.4`, `200Hz τ≈6.57 C≈72.3`, `400Hz τ≈9.88 C≈63.4` (data_expert cell 10 repeats these) |
| 8 | **My** per-condition C = 90/74/73/62 pF, τ_m = 10.1/5.9/6.6/7.7 ms | GROUNDED | `Bash` per-condition fit output: `25Hz: C=89.8pF … tau=10.1ms`, `100Hz C=73.6 tau=5.9`, `200Hz C=72.6 tau=6.6`, `400Hz C=62.0 tau=7.7` |
| 9 | "capacitance **near-exactly**" | OVERSTATED (minor) | 3 of 4 match within 1–2 pF (73/74, 72/73, 63/62), but 25 Hz is 86 vs 90 (~4 pF / 4.4%). "closely" is accurate; "near-exactly" is slightly generous for the 25 Hz pair |
| 10 | Confirmed low-pass via I→V cross-correlation lags | GROUNDED | DV cell 9 `xcorr_peak_lag_ms 4.1 / 2.1 / 1.7 / 1.1`; data_expert cell 10 "cross-corr lags of 4.1, 2.1, 1.7, and 1.1 ms" |
| 11 | Used `project.md` + `work/<slug>/README.md` convention | GROUNDED | `Write project.md`; `Write work/explore-data/README.md` (+ later derive-equation/fit-model/predict-heldout/write-report READMEs) |
| 12 | Invoked `asta-dev:research-challenge`, router → reflect | GROUNDED | `Skill(asta-dev:research-challenge)` → router text; `Read …/research-challenge/workflows/reflect.md` |
| 13 | run precondition = `project.md`; only skill bootstrap is conversational `brainstorm` ("Confirm before writing… wait for explicit approval") | DOC | run `SKILL.md` "Preconditions: `project.md` exists. If not, hand off to **brainstorm**"; brainstorm `SKILL.md` step 4 "Confirm before writing… wait for explicit approval" |
| 14 | Agent can write `project.md` directly (I did), run then proceeds | GROUNDED | `Write project.md` was done by hand (no brainstorm run); subsequent work proceeded |
| 15 | plan-work→review-plan, do-work→review-work are gated review loops | DOC | plan-work `SKILL.md` "Invoke **review-plan**"; do-work `SKILL.md` "invoke **review-work**" |
| 16 | Skipping the gates caused no problems; whole run finished without the **skills** asking the user anything | GROUNDED (nuance) | No `AskUserQuestion` call was ever made; no skill emitted a user prompt. Nuance: the user *volunteered* several mid-turn messages (e.g. q=4), but none were solicited by a skill/agent prompt |
| 17 | analyze-data mandates a chat confirmation ("Confirm with one chat question… Wait for the user's response"); I skipped it; no `--yes` documented | DOC + GROUNDED | analyze-data `SKILL.md` Step 2 shows that text; I proceeded straight to `submit` without it |
| 18 | DataVoyager bailed on the 3-part question; answered (1)&(3); verbatim apology | GROUNDED | submit question had parts (1) passive params (2) spike metrics (3) low-pass; `dv_answer` = "I'm sorry, but I can't fully answer… we have not yet extracted the spike metrics you requested" (it did address passive params + xcorr low-pass) |
| 19 | Ran only **~15** notebook cells | GROUNDED | `Bash` parse of DV log → `total cells: 15` |
| 20 | Wrote spike-detection code (a `programmer` cell) but never returned spike metrics | GROUNDED | DV `programmer` cell 8 = spike-detection code (zero-crossings, `dVdt>20`); `dv_answer` confirms metrics not delivered |
| 21 | Result is a raw DATAVOYAGER notebook-log JSON, **~140 KB**, parsed by hand | GROUNDED | `Bash` parse → `[logs] (list, len 142872 …)` (~140 KB); multiple hand-parse `Bash`/python calls followed |
| 22 | Step 6 export is a separate (Asta Artifacts) skill | DOC | analyze-data `SKILL.md` Step 6 "hand off to the **Asta Artifacts** skill to export" |
| 23 | Mid-run reset: history → single commit, earlier commit gone | GROUNDED | `Bash: git log --oneline` → only `801c35f Neuron model-recovery task…`; my prior "Set up Asta-assistant project scaffold" commit absent |
| 24 | index.qmd/references.bib/.gitignore reverted; venv rebuilt | GROUNDED | `Read index.qmd` → 95-byte reverted version; `references.bib` empty; system note ".gitignore modified"; `Bash: ls venv/bin/activate` → "No such file or directory", then `python3 -m venv venv` re-run |
| 25 | `scratch/` and `model/` survived the reset | GROUNDED | `Bash: ls scratch/` → `fast_glif.py … finalize.py …`; `ls model/` → `glif_fit.py params.json predict.py` |
| 26 | Re-committed `model/` and `predictions/` afterward | GROUNDED | `Bash: git commit … "Fit GIF model + held-out predictions + figures"` (ceb1703) added `model/*`, `predictions/*`, `figures/*` |
| 27 | generate-theories / experiment / find-literature **not used** | GROUNDED | No `Skill()` call for any of the three anywhere in the session |
| 28 | Model form over-determined by dynamic I–V + phase plot + STA | GROUNDED | figures produced: `scratch/spike_dynamics.png`, `figures/fig_ivcurve.png` (dynamic I–V + phase), and STA analysis in exploration |
| 29 | `experiment` is "framed for software experiments" | DOC | asta-tools:experiment listing: "Run scientific (software) experiments" |
| 30 | research-challenge `reflect` is conversational + writes `RESEARCH_CHALLENGE.md` | DOC | `reflect.md` "This workflow is conversational" and "Output file: `RESEARCH_CHALLENGE.md`" |
| — | All "Suggested change" bullets | N/A (proposals) | Recommendations, not factual claims — no grounding applies |

## Summary

- **GROUNDED:** 24  ·  **DOC (grounded as documentation):** 7 (#13,15,17,22,29,30 and the doc half of others)  ·  **OVERSTATED (minor):** 2  ·  **UNSUPPORTED:** 0

**Nothing in `SKILLS_FEEDBACK.md` is fabricated** — every factual/experiential claim traces to a real
tool call/output in this conversation, and the "documentation" claims trace to skill `SKILL.md` text
that was actually shown here.

### The two OVERSTATED items to fix
1. **"capacitance near-exactly"** (row 9): true for 3 of 4 conditions (within 1–2 pF) but the 25 Hz
   pair is 86 vs 90 pF (~4 pF). Change "near-exactly" → "closely."
2. **"the review-/save-work skills I only saw named in the router's state table"** (row 4): they were
   *also* named inside `plan-work`/`do-work` `SKILL.md`, not only the router table. Change to "named
   in the router table and referenced by plan-work/do-work" (or just "referenced but never opened").

### One nuance worth a word (row 16)
"the skills never needed to ask the user anything" is true (no `AskUserQuestion`, no skill prompt),
but the user *did* volunteer information mid-run (e.g. the q=4 grading metric). The claim is about the
skills not soliciting input, which holds — but a reader could misread it as "the user never said
anything," which isn't the case.

## Resolution (applied after this audit)

All three items above were corrected in `SKILLS_FEEDBACK.md`:
1. Row 9 — "capacitance **near-exactly**" → "capacitance **to within ~1–4 pF**".
2. Row 4 — "review-/save-work skills I **only saw named in the router's state table**" →
   "review-/save-work skills I **never opened — only saw them referenced**".
3. Row 16 nuance — added the parenthetical "(the user volunteered some guidance mid-run — e.g. the
   grading metric — but no skill ever prompted for it)".

Net verdict after the fixes: **0 UNSUPPORTED, 0 OVERSTATED remaining** — every claim in
`SKILLS_FEEDBACK.md` is grounded in this conversation (as an event) or in skill `SKILL.md` text that
was actually displayed here (as documentation).
